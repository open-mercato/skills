# Claim-conflict check (step 0)

Auto-skills MUST NOT clobber each other. Before doing anything else, decide whether you may claim this PR. Resolve `CURRENT_USER` via the tracker operation **current-user**, then fetch the PR via **get-pr** requesting the fields `assignees,labels,number,title,body,headRefName,baseRefName,isCrossRepository,comments`.

A PR is **already in progress** when ANY of the following is true:

- It carries the `in-progress` label.
- It has at least one assignee whose login is not `$CURRENT_USER`.
- A claim comment newer than 30 minutes exists from another actor (look for the `🤖` start marker).

Decision tree:

| State | `--force` set? | Action |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Not in progress | — | Claim and proceed. |
| In progress, current user owns the lock | — | Treat as re-entry; proceed without re-claiming. |
| In progress, someone else owns the lock | no | **STOP.** Ask the user: "PR #{prNumber} is in progress (owner: {owner}, signal: {label/assignee/comment}). Override and continue?" Only continue when the user explicitly says yes. |
| In progress, someone else owns the lock | yes | Post a force-override comment naming the previous owner, then claim and proceed. |

Stale lock recovery:

- If the `in-progress` label is older than 60 minutes and the assignee did not push or comment in that window, treat it as expired. Still ask the user before overriding unless `--force` was set.
