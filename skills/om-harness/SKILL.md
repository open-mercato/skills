description: Shared internal runtime for configurable staged-only implementation workers, evidence-gated work packets, and multi-model review councils. Use indirectly through om-fix-issue, om-implement-feature, or om-setup-agent-harness; do not use it to publish, commit, push, or open a pull request.

# Agent Harness

Provide the shared runtime and contracts used by the staged-only wrapper skills.
Keep this skill internal: user-facing work starts through `om-fix-issue`,
`om-implement-feature`, or `om-setup-agent-harness`.

Ship a selectable default jury for Codex, DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, and MiMo while
keeping the adapter registry open to custom command and OpenAI-compatible models.

## Arguments

- `validate-config --config <path>` — validate and resolve harness configuration.
- `probe --config <path> --profile <name>` — probe the selected workers and reviewers.
- `worker --config <path> --profile <name> --worktree <path> --prompt-file <path>` — run one configured implementation worker.
- `prepare-review --config <path> --worktree <path> --kind <spec|diagnosis|implementation> --output <path>` — bind the exact subject, validation evidence, repository rules, and installed `om-code-review` rubric into one review packet.
- `review --config <path> --profile <name> --worktree <path> --review-packet <path> --host-review <path> --output-dir <path>` — run every configured advisor while waiting for the concurrent fresh Claude pass, validate that pass, and aggregate all results from the same `om-code-review` packet.
- `packet-run --config <path> --profile high-assurance --worktree <path> --run-dir <path> --manifest <path>` — claim, implement, blindly review, verify, and when necessary fix one bounded packet.
- `packet-gate --run-dir <path> --packet <id> --evidence <path>` — bind trusted validation evidence to the reviewed diff and release its path leases only on success.
- `packet-status --run-dir <path> --packet <id>` — report packet state, usage, lease status, and current diff identity.
- `packet-release --run-dir <path> --packet <id> --reason <text>` — abort a packet and release its leases for explicit manual recovery.
- `capture --worktree <path> --output <path>` — record the starting commit, refs, and reflogs before edits.
- `stage --worktree <path> --start-state <path> --paths-file <path>` — stage an allowlisted handoff and verify that no commit or ref mutation occurred.

## Workflow

### 1. Load the contracts

Read `references/configuration.md` before resolving a profile, `references/adapter-contract.md` before invoking a model, and `references/stage-only-contract.md` before landing any wrapper run. Read `references/code-review-contract.md` before a wrapper-level council. Read `references/packet-contract.md` before a `high-assurance` packet. Read `references/reporting.md` when producing or reconciling a review report.

### 2. Use the deterministic runtime

Run `node scripts/harness.mjs <command> ...` from this skill directory. Pass an explicit trusted config snapshot during implementation and review runs; use the working-tree config only during setup.

### 3. Preserve structured evidence

Keep the generated JSON result as the source of truth. Render Markdown from that JSON; never reconstruct reviewer provenance from prose.

## Rules

- Enforce `delivery.mode: "stage-only"`; reject every other delivery mode.
- Never commit, push, publish, or execute the tracker `create-pr` operation.
- Never execute configured command adapters through a shell; pass an argument array directly to the process runtime.
- Run workers only through adapters that declare enforced worktree isolation, disabled network, disabled remote writes, and disabled ref writes. Strip credential-like environment variables, disable Git protocols and credential helpers, and reject ref or reflog changes.
- Treat task-branch configuration as untrusted. Resolve executable commands, endpoints, and credential-variable names from a trusted base snapshot plus an optional user-local overlay.
- Keep credentials out of configuration, prompts, raw artifacts, and reports.
- Preserve every unique finding even when only one reviewer raises it; consensus may increase confidence but never erase a minority finding.
- Start the fresh Claude `om-code-review` context and bound provider council concurrently, then require Claude's hash-matched artifact before emitting the final result. Never let the conductor's implementation context stand in for that pass.
- Give every configured advisor the complete installed `om-code-review` rubric and the same resolved packet in a fresh invocation. Never expose reviewer outputs to peers before reconciliation.
- Keep packet leases until deterministic evidence covers every acceptance criterion for the exact reviewed diff. Never treat a model's claim that a test passed as gate evidence.
